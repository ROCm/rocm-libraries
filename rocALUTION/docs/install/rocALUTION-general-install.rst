Installing rocALUTION
**************************

rocALUTION is installed with HIP SDK for Windows or ROCm as a single-node, accelerator-enabled library. 

To use a different configuration, such as a multi-node configuration, rocALUTION can be built from source code.

To build rocALUTION from source, use the branch of rocALUTION in the `rocALUTION GitHub repository <https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocALUTION>`_ that corresponds to the version of HIP SDK for Windows or ROCm that is installed, and follow the :doc:`instructions for Windows <./rocALUTION-windows-build-and-install>` or the :doc:`instructions for Linux <./rocALUTION-linux-build-and-install>`.
