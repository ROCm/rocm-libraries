# Known issues: gfx1250 MXF4 subtile

## Correctness failures outside the common-test shapes (open, found 2026-09-30)

Reproduce on GPU 3:

```bash
TENSILE_YAML=configs/regress_subtile_mxf4.yaml ./run.sh tensile
```

The config has the two kernels from `Tensile/Tests/common/gemm/gfx12/subtile_mxf4_gfx1250.yaml`
(TN, e8 scales, block 32, DepthU 256, PGR 2, StreamK 3, TDMInst 3), with beta = 1 and random C.
Sizes are (M, N, batch, K).

| Kernel | Size | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MT128x64, MI 32x16, WT 2x2 | (128, 64, 1, 256), (128, 64, 1, 512), (256, 128, 1, 256), (96, 48, 1, 256), (128, 64, 1, 384) | pass |
| | (1000, 500, 2, 768) | wrong values, 7713 of 1000000 |
| | (128, 64, 3, 4096) | wrong values, 6141 of 24576 |
| | (200, 100, 1, 1152) | wrong values, 720 of 20000 |
| MT256x256, MI 32x16, WT 4x8 | (4096, 4096, 1, 8192), (256, 256, 1, 256), (512, 512, 1, 2048), (2048, 1024, 1, 384) | pass |
| | (1000, 700, 1, 1280) | wrong values, 25445 of 700000 |
| | (300, 200, 2, 1152) | wrong values, 13786 of 120000 |
| | (256, 256, 1, 8192) | illegal memory access (GPU hang, aborts the client) |

- Not caused by the 32x16 accumulator row fix-up (`emitWmma32x16AccRowFixup`). Tensile built
  from `e91596bfb48`, before that fix, has the same pass/fail result on every size. The count of
  wrong values differs slightly between the two builds.
- Every batch > 1 size fails. Some single-batch sizes with partial M/N tiles and K of 1152 or 1280
  also fail. Edge-only (96, 48, 1, 256) and tail-only (128, 64, 1, 384) sizes pass.
- The crash is one 256x256 tile with a long K, so StreamK 3 splits a single tile's K range
  across workgroups. The partial-tile fixup is the first suspect.
- Not yet checked: the same sizes with StreamK 0, and whether the non-subtile MXF4 kernel
  (`configs/ref_nonsubtile_mxf4.yaml`) passes them.
