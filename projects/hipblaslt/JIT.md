# hipBLASLt just-in-time (JIT) GEMM generation

This source guide describes just-in-time (JIT) kernel generation for general
matrix multiplication (GEMM) in hipBLASLt. It is written for hipBLASLt and
TensileLite contributors and integration developers, and it is maintained under
the existing @ROCm/hipblaslt-reviewers and @ROCm/hipblaslt-docs-reviewers rules
in [.github/CODEOWNERS](../../.github/CODEOWNERS). It is not a released
application programming interface (API) or support statement. Release-document
integration is undecided.

It describes what the code implements today. "Implemented" means present in the
source, not released or approved as product naming. A JIT backend is the
generator that turns a request into kernel sources; this page describes the
parts of hipBLASLt around any backend. The
[JIT test guide](clients/tests/jit/README.md) covers building and running the
tests.

## Summary

hipBLASLt runs a GEMM with a kernel from its pre-tuned library, so a problem
that the library serves poorly, or not at all, has no better kernel available.
JIT generation produces kernels for a problem when they are needed. The `Jit`
component defines the stages of that generation and the order in which they
run. Its interfaces, a comgr code-object builder and a TensileLite solution
loader are implemented. Internal entry points let the JIT test binaries
generate a GEMM solution through a backend and run it with `hipblasLtMatmul`
or `hipblaslt_ext::Gemm`. The only backend is a test mock that replays
pre-generated source bundles. No generator backend or solution store is
implemented yet, and no public API reaches JIT.

## Current behavior

### Entry points

The internal entry points, in `library/src/amd_detail/hipblaslt-jit.hpp`,
generate through `Jit`, keep generated algorithms in one process-local
registry, and return an algorithm for the existing C and C++ GEMM execution
APIs:

- A backend factory, such as `jit::mock::createBackend`, returns a `Backend`
  handle that owns a `Jit` configured with that backend.
- `jit::makeGemmRequest` captures existing GEMM descriptors and host scalars.
- `jit::getJitAlgo` compiles on the selected device and returns an owned
  `Solution`.
- `jit::getGemmAlgo` adapts the solution to the algorithm that
  `hipblasLtMatmul` and `Gemm` accept.

The header is internal, as are `hipblaslt-jit-mock.hpp` and
`hipblaslt-jit-gemm-internal.hpp`: they are not installed and
`hipblaslt-ext.hpp` does not include them. `libhipblaslt.so` exports three
functions and one type from them with `HIPBLASLT_EXPORT` for the JIT test
binaries, which link against the shared library: `jit::makeGemmRequest`,
`jit::getJitAlgo`, `jit::getGemmAlgo` and the `jit::detail::GemmRequest`
request type. A build with `HIPBLASLT_JIT_TESTING=ON` also exports
`jit::mock::createBackend`. No installed header declares them, and they are
not a supported API.

The backend's configuration belongs to the options of its factory. The
application owns its buffers and workspace. The request owns descriptor values
and host scalars; it does not take ownership of device pointers. Compilation
and support checks finish before graphics processing unit (GPU) work is
submitted; call the entry points before stream capture. GEMM is the
implemented operation.

Internally, the GEMM request reuses `RocblasltContractionProblem` with owned
scalar values. The generic `Solution` and private `CompiledSolution` retain
the `Jit`, device target, request, workspace and bundle lifetime around the
existing GEMM support and execution machinery. A matmul algorithm is an
adaptation token, not a general owning executable object.

### Components

`Jit`, in `library/src/amd_detail/hipblaslt-jit-component.{hpp,cpp}`, runs one
request for one device target through these stages. Each stage is an
interface, so that each implementation can be replaced and tested on its own.

| Stage | Interface | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generate | `Backend::generate(GenerationRequest, std::vector<GeneratedSolution>&)` | Returns up to `GenerationRequest::count` solutions, best first, and builds and loads nothing. Each `GeneratedSolution` holds a one-solution TensileLite library entry, its main kernel name, and the source units to build. `NotSupported` means the request is outside the backend's domain. |
| Build | `CodeObjectBuilder::build(GeneratedSolution, GenerationRequest, BuiltSolution&)` | Builds a solution's units into code objects. `GeneratedSolution` has no code-object field; only `BuiltSolution` adds the main code object and its helpers. |
| Support | `SolutionLoader::support` | Evaluates the entry's predicates and workspace for the request, and loads no code. |
| Publish | `SolutionStore::publish` | Stores built solutions and returns one library index per solution, in order. `SolutionStore::lookup` returns the indices of stored solutions for exactly a request. |
| Load | `SolutionLoader::load` | Loads the code objects into a process-local executable `KernelBundle`. |

`Jit::generate` is the only code that sequences these stages. It asks the
backend for at most the requested count of solutions in a private scratch
directory, forwarding the workspace limit and the kernels the caller already
has. It then builds each solution and checks its support until the count is
reached. With a store it publishes the supported solutions, and loads them only
when publishing fails; without a store it loads them. A failure in one
solution's build or support skips that solution and keeps the rest.

Each failure is recorded with its stage (configure, generate, build, support,
load or publish) in `Jit::Outcome::failures`, in the order it happened.
The scratch directory is created under the temporary directory, removed when
the call succeeds, and kept after a failure that left files in it. `Jit`
requires a backend, a builder and a loader; the store is optional. One `Jit`
can generate from several threads at once.

`OperationRequest` names only its kind, so `Jit` sees no GEMM. The interfaces
are for compiled-in implementations and do not establish a stable external
plugin application binary interface (ABI).

The implementations are:

- Code-object builder: `makeComgrBuilder()`; see
  [building generated sources](#building-generated-sources).
- Loader: `makeTensileLoader()`, in `hipblaslt-jit-loader.cpp`, parses the
  entry, checks support and workspace with TensileLite's predicates, and loads
  the code object into a process-local `TensileBundle`.
- Mock backend: `hipblaslt-jit-mock-backend.cpp` replays a list of source
  bundles without a generator. A generation returns, in list order, up to the
  requested count of bundles whose predicates accept the device and problem,
  skipping excluded kernels; the comgr builder still builds them. Its faults
  fail generation and leave a log in the scratch directory, replace the main
  kernel assembly with an invalid instruction so the build fails, append the
  request to a file and fail, or abort the process. Tests reach it through
  `jit::mock::createBackend` in `hipblaslt-jit-mock.hpp`. Only builds with
  `HIPBLASLT_JIT_TESTING=ON` compile it; it is not a production backend.

### Build

`HIPBLASLT_ENABLE_JIT` is disabled by default. A disabled build compiles and
exports no JIT entry points. The enabled build requires the host library, ROCm
and ROCm's `amd_comgr` CMake package, which only a JIT build links. comgr
compiles helper sources against the host's C and C++ standard library headers,
so those must be installed where JIT runs. From the repository root:

```bash
project_root="$PWD"
project_build="$project_root/projects/hipblaslt/build/release"
cmake -S "$project_root/projects/hipblaslt" -B "$project_build" \
  -DHIPBLASLT_ENABLE_JIT=ON -DHIPBLASLT_ENABLE_HOST=ON \
  -DHIPBLASLT_BUILD_TESTING=ON \
  -DHIPBLASLT_ENABLE_DEVICE=OFF -DGPU_TARGETS=gfx950
cmake --build "$project_build" --parallel
```

The `jit` CMake preset enables this feature for a new configuration.
`HIPBLASLT_JIT_TESTING`, off by default, also compiles the mock backend into
the library and adds the tests that use it. The
[JIT test guide](clients/tests/jit/README.md) lists the test targets and the
validation commands.

### Algorithm lifetime and failures

The returned heuristic result contains the required workspace size. Supply that
workspace and follow the same handle, stream and workspace sharing rules as
`hipblasLtMatmul` and `Gemm` calls using prebuilt algorithms. All helper
entrypoints are resolved before submission. Stream-K uses the handle's
stream-specific synchronization region; MultipleBufferSingleKernel and
output-amax use its shared synchronization storage. Registry synchronization
protects algorithm lookup; it does not protect application buffers or make
simultaneous calls on one `Gemm` object safe.

Copies of an algorithm remain usable on its generating device within the same
process, and its modules are retained until process exit. Reuse within one
program invocation needs no recompilation. The opaque algorithm bytes that
`getJitAlgo` and `getGemmAlgo` return are not a library index:
`hipblaslt_ext::getIndexFromAlgo` returns -1 for them, and a different program
invocation cannot use them. Save the bundle manifests for reproduction.

An empty GEMM output (M=0 or N=0) returns `HIPBLAS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED` from
the request factory without compilation. K=0 can use a solution that
implements beta*C. The backend owns its datatype, instruction and scale-layout
restrictions. The library propagates support failures, including a mismatch
between the supplied physical MX scale layout and the compiled solution. Jit
never benchmarks generated solutions. A failed build names the retained
`comgr.log` in its message.

### Building generated sources

Generators emit assembly or HIP source plus metadata only; they do not assemble,
link or bundle. `makeComgrBuilder()` returns the `CodeObjectBuilder` that builds
code objects in process through AMD comgr (`hipblaslt-jit-builder.cpp` and
`hipblaslt-jit-code-object.cpp`). It uses three comgr actions:

- Assembly: `AMD_COMGR_ACTION_ASSEMBLE_SOURCE_TO_RELOCATABLE`. A unit's
  `.amdgcn_target` directive must name the device's processor and only
  features the device has; it is then rewritten to the device's full target
  ID. Assembly units that declare different wavefront sizes are rejected.
- HIP helper source: `AMD_COMGR_ACTION_COMPILE_SOURCE_TO_RELOCATABLE` with
  `--rocm-path` and a content-derived `-cuid`, so helper objects link together.
  The ROCm path is `HIP_PATH` when set, otherwise the prefix of the loaded HIP
  runtime.
- Link: `AMD_COMGR_ACTION_LINK_RELOCATABLE_TO_EXECUTABLE` joins the main kernel
  and helper relocatables into one code object per solution, with
  `-Xlinker --build-id=sha1`.

The generator and the builder use the same code-object version, which
`GenerationRequest::codeObjectVersion` carries (4 by default). The output is a
raw, uncompressed executable code object. comgr cannot bundle or compress it,
and `hipModuleLoadData` accepts raw executable and linkable format (ELF)
objects. A generator needs no offload bundler.

After linking, the builder reads the code object's metadata and checks that its
instruction set architecture (ISA) is the device's and that it defines the
solution's main kernel. A build failure has the build stage. Its message
carries the first error line of the comgr log, and the builder appends the full
log to `comgr.log` in the request's scratch directory and names that file in
the message.

comgr's own on-disk cache (`~/.cache/comgr`) keeps its default: hipBLASLt never
sets `AMD_COMGR_CACHE`. That cache holds the results of comgr actions for every
comgr user in the process, such as hipRTC, and comgr reads its setting once per
process.

### Source bundle format

A source bundle is a generated solution stored as a directory.
`source_bundle::readSourceBundle`, in `hipblaslt-jit-source-bundle.hpp`, reads
one by directory convention:

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `library/TensileLibrary.dat.zlib`, `.dat` or `.yaml` | The one-solution library entry; exactly one of them, decoded when compressed |
| `sources/*.s` | The main kernel assembly; at least one |
| `sources/Kernels.cpp` | The helper kernels, when the solution needs helpers |
| Other files in `sources/` | Headers that the helper source includes |
| `manifest.json` | A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) provenance record that hipBLASLt does not read |

Artifact paths must be relative and stay inside the bundle, including through
symbolic links, and `sources/` may hold only regular files. The reader bounds
the file count (1024), each file (64 MiB), the decoded library (64 MiB) and the
sources in total (256 MiB).

The JIT tests use gfx950 source bundles committed in `clients/tests/jit/data`.
Their manifests record the kernel-argument and persistent-loop argument layout
versions of the generator that wrote them, and the `jit-bundle-freshness` test
fails when those differ from the ones in
`tensilelite/Tensile/Common/GlobalParameters.py`, when the code-object version
differs from the builder's, or when a bundle no longer reads or builds.
[Their README](clients/tests/jit/data/README.md) gives the commands that
regenerate them.
