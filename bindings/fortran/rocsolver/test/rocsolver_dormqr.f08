! dormqr example (double-precision multiplication by Q from a QR factorization)
! see: https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocSOLVER/en/latest/reference/lapack.html
!
! Self-verifying: factorize A with geqrf to obtain Q (as Householder vectors),
! then apply Q and Q**T successively to a matrix C. Since Q**T * Q = I, the
! result must recover the original C, so no reference matrix is needed.
