rocJPEG provides APIs and samples that you can use to easily access the JPEG decoding
features of your media engines (VCNs). It also allows interoperability with other compute engines on
the GPU using Video Acceleration API (VA-API)/HIP. To learn more, see :doc:`what-is-rocJPEG`

The rocJPEG public repository is located at `https://github.com/ROCm/rocJPEG <https://github.com/ROCm/rocJPEG>`_.
