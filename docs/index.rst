********************************************************************

rocPRIM is a header-only library that provides HIP parallel primitives. The purpose of the library is to help maintain  GPU-accelerated code on the AMD ROCm platform. rocPRIM is written in HIP and has been optimized for AMD's latest discrete GPUs.

The rocPRIM public repository is located at https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocPRIM.
