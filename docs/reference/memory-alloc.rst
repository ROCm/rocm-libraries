Device memory allocation in rocBLAS
********************************************************************
rocBLAS uses per-handle device memory allocation to manage temporary memory efficiently. Each handle maintains its own memory and executes kernels sequentially in a single stream, allowing memory reuse across kernels.

There are two memory allocation schemes:

*  **rocBLAS_managed(default)**:  By default rocBLAS internally manages memory, allocating more if needed. Allocated memory persists with the handle for reuse.

*  **user_owned**: Users allocate memory and provide it to rocBLAS via ``rocblas_set_workspace``.

rocBLAS_managed is the default scheme, this scheme uses ``hipMallocAsync`` and ``hipFreeAsync`` (stream-order allocation) to allocate and free memory in stream order, avoiding global synchronization. This enables seamless stream switching without needing ``hipStreamSynchronize()``.

The following computational functions use temporary device memory.

Memory allocation functions
==============================================

rocBLAS includes functions for manually setting the memory size and determining the memory requirements.

Function for setting a user-owned workspace
----------------------------------------------

* ``rocblas_set_workspace``

Functions for determining memory requirements
----------------------------------------------

*  ``rocblas_start_device_memory_size_query``
*  ``rocblas_stop_device_memory_size_query``
*  ``rocblas_is_managing_device_memory``

See the API section for information about these functions.

rocBLAS function return values for insufficient device memory
=============================================================

If the user manually allocates (user-owned scheme) using ``rocblas_set_workspace(rocblas_handle handle, void* addr, size_t size)``, that size is used as the limit and no resizing or synchronizing ever occurs.
The following two function return values indicate insufficient memory:

*  ``rocblas_status == rocblas_status_memory_error`` : indicates there is insufficient device memory for a rocBLAS function.
*  ``rocblas_status == rocblas_status_perf_degraded`` : indicates that a slower algorithm was used because of insufficient device memory for the optimal algorithm.

Switching streams without synchronization
----------------------------------------------

Stream-order memory allocation lets the application switch streams without having to call ``hipStreamSynchronize()``.
