hipRAND data type support
=========================

The data type support in hipRAND is similar to NVIDIA CUDA cuRAND. On AMD hardware, the backend is provided by rocRAND. To see the data type comparison between
rocRAND and cuRAND, see :doc:`rocRAND data type support <rocrand:api-reference/data-type-support>`.

You can find a summary of the ROCm data type support at `Supported data types in ROCm <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/about/compatibility/precision-support.html#data-type-support-in-rocm-libraries>`_.
